The init subcommand initializes state-based configuration for vagrant_spec. 

If the config.spec.ansible_inventory configuration directive is used within the 
Vagrantfile, then init will generate a test inventory file 
vagrantspec_inventory. This file can be used for ansible orchestration against 
the Vagrant instances. 

By default, init will generate a json file containing machine data for each 
Vagrant instance at .vagrantspec_machine_data. This file can be used by
orchestration tooling aside from ansible to map events to vagrant nodes. The
config.spec.generate_machine_data configuration parameter controls the 
generation of this file.
